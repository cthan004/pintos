         ARGUMENT PASSING
         ================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

We use a for loop to tokenize the entire argument string using strtok_r.
We store the tokens into argv[] as they are tokenized.
The tokens will naturally be stored in order because strtok_r
progresses through the argument string from left to right.


---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

strtok modifies the string that is being tokenized while
strtok_r does not.
This is important because pintos should not modify the strings
that the user is passing into the system. 

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.

The Unix approach means that the delimiters for the argument
tokenization can be explicitly chosen by the user instead of being
forced by the OS.

Also, tokenization is not something that absolutely needs to be
implemented into the kernel.
Implementing the tokenization into the kernel would also mean that any bugs in
the tokenization would be passed on to the user.

In summary, the unix way pushes the responsibilty of upkeep to the user and
gives them more freedom in the implementation.

           SYSTEM CALLS
           ============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

When files are opened, file descriptors are created.
File descriptors are unique just within a single process.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

>> to be copied from user space into the kernel.  What is the least

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

>> B6: Any access to user program memory at a user-specified address
>> can fail due to a bad pointer value.  Such accesses must cause the

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

We down a semaphore to block before loading to make sure
that "exec" return after load finished. We then up after loading.

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

When P call wait before C exits, P is blocked. We unblocked after
C exits. The kernel frees C and P frees some C data.

When P call after C exits, we just have to frees C data in P.

When P terminates before C, P updates C. The new parent of C
is the parent of P.

P terminates after C is the same case as P call wait after
C exits.

There are no more special cases.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

We do not plan to change the default mapping because it is
working.

         SURVEY QUESTIONS
         ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.
